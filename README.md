#### About the Project:

##### "Sentiment Analysis of ESG information through Social Media Data on Stock Prices"
Through this Course of Independent Study (CIS), we aim to analyze the effect of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) related news sentiment on the stock market performance of the selected equities. Using a dictionary technique and a data set of news stories published online (Twitter posts) or in print media on social networking sites, we capture each article's sentiment with regard to ESG-related issues and create a polarity-based sentiment index (positive, negative, neutral). Per the models' results, the investors' apparent proclivity for ESG-news appears to be related to a stock's financial success in most sectors.
